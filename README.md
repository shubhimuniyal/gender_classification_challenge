##Overview

This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.

##Dependencies

    Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
    numpy (pip install numpy)
    scipy (pip install scipy)

Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

python gender_classifer.py

##Challenge

Find 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn documentation and add them to the demo.py code. Train them on the same dataset and compare their results.
